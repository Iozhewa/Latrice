STOP POSTING ABOUT AMONG US! I'M TIRED OF SEEING IT! My friends on TikTok send me memes, on Discord its *** memes. I was in a server, right, and ALL the channels are 
just Among Us stuff. I showed my Champion underwear to my girlfriend, and the logo I flipped it and I said "Hey babe, when the underwear sus! HAHA! 
Ding Ding Ding Ding Ding Ding Ding DiDiDing!" I looked at a trash can and I said "Thats a bit sussy!" I looked at ***, I thought of the astronauts helmet and I go 
"***? MORE LIKE PEN-SUS!" AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
