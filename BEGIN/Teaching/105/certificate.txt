I have gotten the covid vaccine about 20 times now. 4 Pfizer, 12 moderna, 4 Johnson. Once I got my first vaccine, I started cravings for it. 
  There is something so great knowing I am reducing the spread of the coronavirus with each of them. I am feeling so empowered. 
  I think I may be addicted ngl :sweat_smile:. At least it won't kill me.
